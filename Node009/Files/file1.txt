Chapter: The Unexpected
A few days later, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, Vishal and I were deeply engrossed in our favorite pastime—playing a video game. The house was unusually quiet because Uncle and Aunty had gone to Gurugram to attend a friend’s function, leaving us in charge. Our peaceful gaming session was abruptly interrupted by the doorbell ringing.
We exchanged nervous glances. Who could it be? With no one else in the house, the unexpected doorbell ring sent a chill down our spines. Our initial instinct was to ignore it, but curiosity got the better of us. After a silent, frantic discussion via raised eyebrows and wide-eyed stares, we decided to open the door but with maximum safety precautions. Vishal, always the cautious one, had his phone ready to dial an emergency number. My phone, unfortunately, had been out of commission since last night due to an accidental drop that killed the display.
The doorbell rang again, adding to our growing anxiety. We took up makeshift defensive positions, influenced no doubt by the countless hours spent playing video games. Ready to scream if necessary, Vishal moved cautiously to the door and counted down from three....3...2....1,. As the latch clicked, we both held our breath.
To our immense relief, it was a familiar face—Rohan, the son of the buildbing’s gatekeeper. Vishal visibly relaxed and shook hands with him. "Kya hua, Rohan?" Vishal asked, trying to sound nonchalant. Rohan handed over a parcel, neatly wrapped in sky-blue polythene. The label clearly stated, "Please do not accept if the seal is broken." Rohan explained that the delivery boy had left it with his father since my phone was unreachable. He added that he had been trying to deliver the parcel since morning and had finally decided to drop it off at our place.
Curiosity piqued, I checked the label. It was addressed to me, "Ashish Pundhir." Thanking Rohan, we took the parcel inside. I was eager to discover the contents. Ignoring Vishal’s skeptical look, I tore open the wrapping with a mix of excitement and anticipation. Inside was a collection of books—all from my bucket list! My joy knew no bounds as I ran my fingers over the glossy covers, feeling the weight of each book.
"Who could have sent these?" Vishal wondered aloud as I inspected each book. I had no clue. The receipt only mentioned my details and those of the seller. Someone very close to me must have known about my wish list. As I flipped through the pages of one of the books, a thought crossed my mind—could it be Mona? But then again, my parents, though usually not inclined to surprise gifts, might have done this. The mystery deepened, and I felt a mix of gratitude and curiosity. Vishal, now more intrigued than skeptical, joined me in speculating who the mysterious benefactor could be.
Determined to solve the mystery, I decided to get my phone repaired. I persuaded Vishal to accompany me to the mobile shop, despite his initial reluctance to leave the house in Uncle and Aunty's absence. After much convincing and promising it would be a quick trip, he reluctantly agreed, and we headed out. The sun was blazing, and the streets were buzzing with activity, but our focus was solely on getting my phone fixed and unraveling the mystery of the unexpected gift.

At the mobile shop, a skinny technician greeted us with a nod. I explained the issue with my phone, detailing the accidental drop and its aftermath. He took it and started working with tools that looked utterly foreign to us. Vishal, meanwhile, got engrossed in a poster of MS Dhoni endorsing a mobile network, where Dhoni was claiming, "Idea is the best network of India." I anxiously watched the technician, hoping my phone could be fixed quickly and without too much expense.
Finally, after twenty minutes, the technician handed back my phone, now working perfectly. I paid the bill, and we left the shop, feeling a mix of relief and curiosity. Eager to uncover the mystery, I checked my call log. Apart from several missed calls from my mother, father, Mona, and Nikki dii, there was an unknown number that could have been the delivery boy’s. My mind raced with possibilities as I tried to piece together who might have sent the thoughtful gift.
Back home, I called Mona, guessing she might have sent the books. The phone rang… once, twice, thrice. Finally, she picked up. Without preamble, I asked, “Did you send me something?” Her confused reply made it clear she hadn’t. With a touch of sarcasm, she added, "It's a nice way to ask for a birthday gift early. I know your birthday is coming up, but who asks like this?" Her comment, while teasing, reminded me that my birthday was indeed approaching. We both laughed, realizing the timing of my question was quite amusing.

We chatted for a while, catching up on everything from mutual friends to recent happenings. Mona shared a hilarious story about her neighbor’s dog, which had somehow managed to get stuck on their roof, causing quite a commotion in her neighborhood. After our call, I spoke with my family. Sundays were the only days I made sure to talk to everyone—my parents, my siblings, and sometimes even a few relatives. It was a tradition I cherished, a little slice of home that kept me grounded.
Once those calls were done, Vishal and I resumed our video game, temporarily setting aside the mystery of the parcel. The game was intense, with both of us yelling and laughing as we tried to outdo each other. It was a much-needed distraction from the puzzle that had been occupying my mind all day.

Then, my phone rang again. It was Nikki dii. We started with the usual pleasantries, discussing our day and exchanging updates. Then she asked, “Did you receive something today? And why was your phone switched off?” That was my answer. Nikki dii had sent the books. A wave of relief and happiness washed over me.
She explained that she had planned the surprise meticulously and called to inform me, but my phone had been off. I thanked her profusely, my heart swelling with gratitude. When I asked how she got my address, she reminded me of last Rakshabandhan when she sent me a rakhi and I had given her my address. I had completely forgotten about that.
Her surprise not only made my day but also signaled the start of my birthday celebrations. It was the best kind of unexpected—a reminder of the love and thoughtfulness of those who care about me. The books were more than just gifts; they were a symbol of the bond we shared.
As I settled down with my new books, Vishal gave me a knowing look. "So, mystery solved?" he asked with a grin. I nodded, feeling a warmth that had nothing to do with the sunny afternoon outside. The whole experience had been a roller coaster of emotions, but it ended on a high note. The unexpected parcel turned out to be a precious reminder of how fortunate I was to have people like Nikki dii and Vishal in my life.
